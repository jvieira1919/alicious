# Eat-Da-Burger

## Eat-Da-Burger is a full-stack app using C.R.U.D.

        This app is using express and MySQL. In this
    app, I created the browser layout with bootstrap's database and my own css codes. The user types into the form, any burger they choose. It then goes into the devour section of the page, with a devour button. Once the devour button is clicked, the burger goes into the delete section with a delete button. The delete button then deletes the data.
    This is my first application using multiple file locations and generic orm.js file.

## Installation

    The required steps to install this project is too in the terminal, npm install or npm i, npm init, npm install express, and npm install mysql.

## Usage

    This app has front end code so can be used in the browser. It is a fun project created to showcase full-stack development and using the C.R.U.D. method.
